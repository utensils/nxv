## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-21

### Fixed

- Incremental indexer no longer creates a duplicate row per
  `(attribute_path, version)` on every run. Each run seeded a fresh
  `open_ranges` map and restamped every still-present package with a new
  `first_commit_hash`; `INSERT OR IGNORE` didn't catch it because the
  UNIQUE constraint includes `first_commit_hash`. Over ~480 CI runs this
  grew the published index to 1.8GB / 1.7M rows against only ~120k
  distinct `(attribute_path, version)` pairs (some duplicated 290×),
  making queries that used to be sub-second take ~15s. Fix seeds
  `open_ranges` from the last checkpoint, switches batch insert to
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` (with sticky `source_path`), flushes
  all open ranges at every periodic checkpoint so a hard kill still
  resumes correctly, and adds `idx_packages_last_commit_hash` to keep the
  resume-seed query fast on large DBs. Existing bloated DBs still need a
  full rebuild to actually remove the duplicate rows. (#24)
- `load_open_ranges_at_commit` collapses duplicate
  `(attribute_path, version)` pairs deterministically via
  `MIN(id) GROUP BY` so seeding from an already-bloated DB picks a stable
  row.

### Changed

- `IndexResult::ranges_created` renamed to `ranges_written`; CLI now
  reports "Range rows written" since the count now includes upsert
  updates, not only inserts.
- Flake modernized: migrated from `flake-utils` to `flake-parts`, added
  `numtide/devshell` with categorized commands and an motd, added
  `treefmt-nix` (`nixfmt` + `rustfmt`). Bumped all flake inputs, refreshed
  the Rust toolchain to `stable.latest` with `rust-src` /
  `rust-analyzer` / `rustfmt` / `clippy`. Added `cargo-outdated`,
  `cargo-audit`, and `cargo-llvm-cov` to the devshell. Fixed Darwin
  `libiconv` linking (`LIBRARY_PATH` + `NIX_LDFLAGS` in `commonArgs`) and
  replaced `pkgs.nodePackages.prettier` with `pkgs.prettier` (nodePackages
  removed upstream). All existing outputs preserved: `overlays.default`,
  `nixosModules.default`/`nxv`, packages, apps, checks. (#24)
- Migrated repository references from `jamesbrink/nxv` to `utensils/nxv`.
- `publish-index` workflow: deep-fallback recovery, improved error
  handling, and `errexit` fix around GitHub API calls.
- Bumped `actions/checkout` to v6 in the FlakeHub workflow.
- CLAUDE.md: documented the local vs. remote backend abstraction,
  enumerated `NXV_*` environment variables, clarified that the indexer
  lives at `src/index/` while the Cargo feature is named `indexer`, and
  added `cargo bench`.
