# Release

Prepare and execute a release for nxv. Run pre-flight checks, generate release
notes, and require explicit user confirmation before making any changes.

## Phase 1: Pre-flight Checks

Run these checks and stop immediately if any fail:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --features indexer -- -D warnings
cargo test --features indexer
markdownlint '**/*.md' --ignore node_modules
nix flake check
git status --porcelain
```

If `git status` shows uncommitted changes, stop and inform the user.

## Phase 2: Gather Release Information

1. Get the current version from `Cargo.toml`.
2. Get the last tag with `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`.
3. Get commits since last tag with `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD`.
4. Read current `CHANGELOG.md` to see unreleased section.

## Phase 3: Determine Version

Follow semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

- **MAJOR** - Breaking changes (API incompatibility, removed features)
- **MINOR** - New features (backward compatible additions)
- **PATCH** - Bug fixes (backward compatible fixes)

Pre-release versions use hyphen suffix (e.g., `0.2.0-rc1`).

Review the commits and suggest an appropriate version bump based on the changes.

## Phase 4: Generate Release Notes

Create markdown release notes with these sections:

- **Features** - New functionality (commits starting with `feat:`)
- **Fixes** - Bug fixes (commits starting with `fix:`)
- **Other** - Everything else (refactor, chore, docs, etc.)

## Phase 5: User Confirmation

Present a summary and ask for confirmation before proceeding:

```text
=== RELEASE SUMMARY ===

Current version: X.Y.Z
Suggested version: A.B.C (reason: <major/minor/patch bump rationale>)

Commits to be released:
  <commit list>

Release Notes:
  <generated notes>

Files to modify:
  1. Cargo.toml - bump version to A.B.C
  2. CHANGELOG.md - move Unreleased items to [A.B.C] section
  3. Cargo.lock - updated automatically by cargo build

Actions after verification:
  4. Run cargo build/test/clippy to verify changes
  5. Commit with message "chore: release A.B.C"
  6. Run isolated Docker nix build (optional)
  7. Create and push tag vA.B.C

CI/CD will then:
  - Build static binaries (Linux x86_64/aarch64, macOS x86_64/ARM64)
  - Create GitHub Release with binaries and checksums
  - Publish to crates.io
  - Push Docker image to ghcr.io/utensils/nxv (timestamp derived from commit)
  - Publish to FlakeHub

Proceed? Enter version number to confirm, or "abort" to cancel.
```

Use `AskUserQuestion` to get confirmation. The user must provide the version
number (e.g., `0.1.4` or `0.2.0`).

## Phase 6: Execute Release

Only proceed after explicit user confirmation with a version number.

### Step 1: Update Cargo.toml

Edit the `version` field to the new version.

### Step 2: Update CHANGELOG.md

Move the `[Unreleased]` section contents to a new version section:

1. Create new section `## [A.B.C] - YYYY-MM-DD` below `[Unreleased]`.
2. Move all content from `[Unreleased]` to the new section.
3. Leave `[Unreleased]` empty (keep the heading).
4. Update the comparison links at the bottom:
   - Change `[unreleased]` link to compare against new tag.
   - Add new version link.

### Step 3: Verify changes

Run a full build and test suite to ensure the version bump doesn't break anything
and to regenerate Cargo.lock with the new version:

```bash
cargo build --features indexer
cargo test --features indexer
cargo clippy --features indexer -- -D warnings
```

If any verification fails, stop and inform the user before committing.

### Step 4: Commit changes

Include Cargo.lock to ensure reproducible builds:

```bash
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: release A.B.C"
```

### Step 5: Verify isolated nix build (optional but recommended)

Run the isolated Docker build to verify the flake builds correctly with no local
state. This catches issues like missing Cargo.lock that would fail in CI:

```bash
./scripts/verify-nix-build.sh
```

If Docker is not available or the user wants to skip, proceed with caution.

### Step 6: Create tag locally

```bash
git tag vA.B.C
```

### Step 7: Push commit and tag

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin vA.B.C
```

### Step 8: Report completion

Provide link to [GitHub Actions][actions] and remind user to monitor the
release workflow.

## Important Notes

- Never proceed past Phase 5 without explicit user confirmation.
- Stop immediately if any pre-flight check fails.
- The changelog must be updated as part of the release.
- Version bumps must follow semver conventions.
- Docker image timestamp is derived automatically from git commit date.
