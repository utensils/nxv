# Getting Started

nxv helps you find specific versions of Nix packages across nixpkgs history.
Whether you need to pin a dependency to an older version or find when a package
was introduced, nxv makes it fast and easy.

::: tip Try Without Installing Use the public web interface at
[nxv.urandom.io](https://nxv.urandom.io/) - no installation required. :::

## Quick Start

### Run Directly (No Install)

```bash
# Run directly via Nix flakes - nothing persisted
nix run github:utensils/nxv -- search python
```

### Install via Shell Script

```bash
# One-liner install (downloads static binary)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/utensils/nxv/main/install.sh | sh

# Update the package index (downloads ~28MB)
nxv update

# Search for a package
nxv search python

# Find a specific version
nxv search python --version 3.11
```

## What You Get

For each package version, nxv provides:

- **Version history** - When each version was first and last available
- **Commit hashes** - Exact nixpkgs commits for reproducibility
- **Ready-to-run commands** - `nix shell` / `nix run` invocations pinned to the
  right commit (or `nix-shell` with `fetchTarball` for pre-flake commits)
- **Security info** - CVE warnings and insecure package markers

## How It Works

nxv uses a pre-built SQLite index containing:

- ~2.8 million package version records
- Package metadata (description, license, homepage)
- Bloom filter for instant "not found" responses

The index is downloaded once and searched locally, so queries are fast and work
offline.
